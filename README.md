Android Photo Backup
====================

An Android application to perform over-the-air encrypted backups of photos to
cloud storage services.  This means that should anyone gain access to your cloud
account they won't necessarily be able to view the images from your 'phone as
each image is stored in an encrypted form.

Why?
----

Google+ [includes
functionality](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1647509?hl=en) to back up
your Android phone's media collection, however some may have concerns about
uploading their photos to Google in a form in which they can be viewed should
anyone get access to your Google Drive account or you may simply not want to use
Google+ and Google Drive to achieve this.  

Android Phone Backup is intended as an alternative to using Google+'s media
backup service - it does, for example, add encryption to the Google+ service.
If you continue to use Google+'s media backup then you will be continuing to
upload viewable images to Google Drive.

It's also important to note that the images on your phone remain unchanged -
they are not encrypted or secured in any way - you should take appropriate
precautions to prevent someone accessing the data on your phone in the case that
it is lost or stolen.
